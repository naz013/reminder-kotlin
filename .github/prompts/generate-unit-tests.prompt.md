description: 'Generate unit tests for selected class/function/method'

## Task

Analyze the selected class/function/method and generate focused unit tests that thoroughly validate its behavior.

## Test Generation Strategy

1. **Core Functionality Tests**
    - Test the main purpose/expected behavior
    - Verify return values with typical inputs
    - Test with realistic data scenarios

2. **Input Validation Tests**
    - Test with invalid input types
    - Test with null/undefined values
    - Test with empty strings/arrays/objects
    - Test boundary values (min/max, zero, negative numbers)

3. **Error Handling Tests**
    - Test expected exceptions are thrown
    - Verify error messages are meaningful
    - Test graceful handling of edge cases

4. **Side Effects Tests** (if applicable)
    - Verify external calls are made correctly
    - Test state changes
    - Validate interactions with dependencies

## Test Structure Requirements

- Use existing project testing framework and patterns
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Write descriptive test names that explain the scenario, use text with spaces instead of camelCase
- Group related tests in describe/context blocks
- Mock external dependencies cleanly using Mockk

Target function: ${input:class_name:Which class, function or method should be tested?}
Testing framework: junit4

## Guidelines

- Generate 5-8 or more (if applicable) focused test cases covering the most important scenarios
- Include realistic test data, not just simple examples
- Add comments for complex test setup or assertions
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order
- Focus on testing behavior, not implementation details

Create tests that give confidence the function works correctly and help catch regressions.
